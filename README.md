# Spotify Data Visualization Web Application

Welcome to the repository of the Spotify Data Visualization Web Application project! The main goal of this project is to implement and deploy a web application that offers users the ability to visualize their historical Spotify data. Spotify, as an online streaming service, provides its clients with access to their listening history. However, this access is not automatic and requires a request on the Spotify webpage. The data can be downloaded in .json format, providing information about what was played, when, and for how long on the user's account. We will deploy and host the app using Amazon Web Services (AWS) to ensure high availability, excellent performance, and cost-effective management.

## Project Overview

### Features

- **Data Visualization**: Users can visualize and analyze their Spotify listening history.
- **User Registration**: Users can create accounts and log in to access enhanced features.
- **Data Management**: Logged-in users can store, manage, and utilize multiple versions of their listening history files.

### AWS for High Availability

To ensure high availability, we will leverage AWS services. The module responsible for managing user accounts will be implemented using Amazon Cognito.

### Project History

The initial version of this application was implemented during the Data Visualization course and can be accessed via this [link](https://example.com/spotify-data-viz-app). Users can request their historical data through their Spotify account settings.

## Getting Started

For detailed instructions on deploying and running the application, please refer to the documentation provided in the repository's "docs" directory.

Contributions to this project are welcome! Whether you have ideas for improving the visualization, adding new features, enhancing performance, or fixing issues, feel free to submit pull requests.

## Requirements

To work on or use this application, you will need a basic understanding of web development technologies and AWS services.
